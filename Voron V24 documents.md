# Voron V2.4 Document map

This document is not meant to teach you anything important about building a V2.4, in and of itself.  What it does try to do, is help you find your way to a bunch of other scattered resources which will help you.
Document | Description
--------- | ----------
Bill of Materials (BOM) | The BOM is your personal, customized shopping list, generated by [the configurator](https://vorondesign.com/voron2.4) It tells you exactly what you need, but not where to find it
[Sourcing guide](https://vorondesign.com/sourcing_guide?model=V2.4) | the sourcing guide is your guide to where to find all the parts you need, based on your BOM.  Although you do not have to use these vendors, it is recommended. The specific products in the sourcing guide have been tested by the devs, and found to be of good quality.  DO NOT CONFUSE THE SOURCING GUIDE WITH YOUR BOM:  The BOM tells you what you need.  The Sourcing Guide helps you find it. Make sure you explore the tabs at the bottom of the sourcing guide:  Some required parts are on the Afterburner Tab, rather than the main V2.4 tab  In addition, there are some very valuable upgrade suggestions on the "Optional Parts" tab.
[Nero's Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Neroga) | Nero3dp has an extensive set of youtube videos about the build of various Voron printers.  If you learn better by watching than by reading, this is definitely the place for you.  That being said, read the descriptions: some of these videos are older, and may not show the most up to date information.  When this is the case, Nero has generally updated the video description to alert you to the changes.
Assembly Manual | The assembly manual, is, of course, your master document for how to physically assemble your V2.4. However, at the time of this writing, it's wiring is actually slightly out of date.  When you have finished the physical assembly, and are ready to start wiring, you should move on to the wiring guides found in the firmware documentation
Firmware Documentation | This folder contains the most up to date wiring documents and klipper configuration files for the 3 supported control configurations:   RAMPS, SKR1.3, and SKR1.4
Eddie's Guide | Although the wiring and klipper configurations in this document are now obsolete, this is still an extremely valuable document:  the walkthrough of how to install klipper, and do some initial startup checks of your printer is still extremely valuable.
Voron Discord | Voron has a large and helpful community.  Whether you're stuck and need help, or just curious how something works, the Voron Discord is the place to be.  There are excellent discussion channels for most things, and if nobody there can help you, #request_help gives you direct access to the voron developers.
[Print it Forward](https://pif.voron.dev/) | Don't have faith in your current printer's ability to print ABS for your Voron build?  No problem!  the PIF program will help you get high quality parts from a rigorously  vetted group of community members.
[Voron2 Github](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2) | All key Voron2 files may be found here, including a Fusion 360 assembly for the entire printer, and all the STLs
[Voron Users Github](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers) | Voron Users is a collection of Mods and other resources for all Voron printers, drawn from the Voron community at large.
